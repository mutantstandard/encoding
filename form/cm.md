# Mutant Form CMs

These are a palette of colors that (unlike human skin tones) can be arbitrarily applied to any color-modifiable emoji.

Modifying emoji with lots of colours is a challenging proposition, and can result in very large emoji sets. After a lot of experiments and careful consideration, Mutant's arbitrary colour palette was made from 45 colours, with the hope that there is enough variance that users will be able to find a colour that approximates their representation *enough* for comfort.

This palette is based on 15 hues/scales at 3 different points of brightness for a total of 45 colours.


### Rainbow palette (R,D,O,Y,L,G,T,C,S,B,V,M,P)
These hues are perceptually spaced to compensate for the abundance of green in human vision and to create a balance of warm and cold hues.

### Brown (E) and Greyscale (K)
The last 2 scales are dedicated to brown and greyscale.

Note that there is no white or black - pure whites and blacks are difficult to display for any emoji design in any design context. It is expected that K1 and K3 can approximate black and white respectively.
