# Combining MMs and CMs


## Basic formula

MMs always come before CMs if they exist - both in the shortcode and the codepoint.

```
[ character to be modified ] + [ MM ]
character_mm

[ character to be modified ] + [ CM ]
character_cm

[ character to be modified ] + [ MM ] + [ CM ]
character_mm_cm
```

## Disallowed combinations

As the name implies, Arbitrary CMs are intended to work with any Morph Modifier. For cultural reasons, Human CMs are limited to only human hand appearances. For users seeking a brown colour on a non-human morph, they can use the E series of colours instead.

| CM group | Morph usages |
| ---- | ---- |
| Human (Hx) | Human only (hmn) |
| Arbitrary | All |
