# What is Mutant Core?

**Mutant Core** is the base bundle of emoji in the Mutant Standard.

It is the Unicode Standard, with various modifications and omissions.

Mutant is a small project, so not all emoji can be explicitly accounted for as the Unicode Standard updates every year. Instead, Mutant Core consists of a series of symbols that are added, changed or excluded versus Unicode Standard.

**Mutant Core** can also be added to via *communication extension* bundles - **Mutant Spectrum** and **Mutant Form**.
