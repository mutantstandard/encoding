# Modifiers

In character encoding, a modifier changes the shape/presentation of an expression without changing the fundamental expression itself.

In typical emoji encoding, modifiers perform these functions:

- Skin tones in symbols where human forms are present.
- Combining symbols into new ones via a Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ - `U+200d`).
- Marking legacy symbols to display like emoji instead of grayscale characters (VS16 - `fe0f`).

One of Mutant's design goals is for people who use nonhuman characters/personas/representations to have symbols that represent them better, so in **Mutant Form**, the idea of using skin tones has been greatly extended beyond what Unicode has created.
