# Color Modifiers (CMs)

Unicode has a series of skin tone modifiers. In Mutant, these are called Color Modifiers - CMs for short.

To make an efficient and easy to remember shortcode encoding for these colours, Mutant uses a notation system inspired by professional drawing markers:

```
<letter indicating rough hue scale> <number indicating level of lightness>

R1 - dark red
R2 - red
R3 - light red
C1 - dark cyan
etc.
```
