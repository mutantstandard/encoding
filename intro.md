# What is Mutant Standard?
Mutant Standard is an emoji standard that is a semi-compatible offshoot of Unicode Standard. 

Various Unicode emoji characters are altered or ignored entirely and there are many new emoji and emoji combinations.

## Why a different standard?
- Unicode and big tech companies should not have a monopoly on digital graphical communication.
- There are needs from various people, who are unlikely to get emoji they would like into the Unicode Standard.
- Unicodeâ€™s emoji system often represents a cultural, political and economic status quo.

## Why a technical standard?
- It enables as many people to benefit from Mutant emoji as much as possible.

## Key points about Mutant Standard
- All people-based glyphs are gender-neutral.
- All gendered Unicode emoji are not used.
- Family and couple ZWJs are not used in favour of letting people place different people together in any configuration they want.
