# What is Mutant Standard?

Mutant Standard is an emoji set and a new emoji encoding standard.

While it is compatible with certain Unicode emoji and characters, both in intent and structure, it is not necessarily an extension of Unicode Standard emoji. Various Unicode emoji characters are altered or ignored entirely.

## Why a new standard?
- Unicode and big tech companies should not have a monopoly on digital graphical communication.
- Unicode’s encoding decisions are largely driven by popularity.
- There are needs from various people, such as minority groups, who are unlikely to get emoji they would like into the Unicode Standard, precisely because Unicode is largely a popularity-based standard.
- Unicode has made (in the eyes of this project) various missteps in how to technically structure codepoints, leading to some serious cultural pitfalls (ie. gendered emoji).
- Unicode’s emoji system represents a cultural, political and economic status quo.
- Unicode emoji encoding is poorly described, and many design decisions are either compensating for those failings, or compensating for how big tech companies (especially Apple) choose to represent emoji in the wake of those failings.

## Why encode at all?
- Encoding creates scenarios where the most people can use and benefit from Mutant Standard as much as possible.
- Creating a scenario where people can use Mutant Standard in as many places as possible can drive exposure to the systemic problems in Unicode emoji.
- Enabling people to use Mutant Standard in as many places as possible could disrupt the usage of Unicode emoji. This is something this project considers desirable.

## Key points about Mutant Standard encodings
- All people-based glyphs are gender-neutral.
- All gendered Unicode emoji are not used.
- Family and couple ZWJs (in planning - these emoji are not yet implemented) are not used in favour of letting people place different people together in any configuration they want.
