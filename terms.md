## codepoint
A number (represented in hexadecimal) that represents a single block of data in Unicode text encoding. As long as it's not in the Private Use Area, codepoints are generally 1:1 consistent across platforms and systems (as long as it has the software updates and/or fonts to display the characters that are being encoded).

## shortcode 
A string that represents an approachable and linguistic shorthand for people to input emoji in various platforms and software. Shortcodes are not universal across all emoji sets and/or platforms.
