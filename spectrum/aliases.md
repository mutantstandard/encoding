# Codepoint sequence aliases

At the time the transgender flag was added to Mutant Standard's PUA, it was not anticipated that other vendors would decide to encode it as a symbol, but WhatsApp did, followed by Unicode.

This means that Mutant has a completely different alternate encoding to the same symbol that Unicode also has a codepoint sequence for.

Mutant recommends treating each of these sequences as pointing to an identical symbol, but take precedence with Unicode's version when it comes to user input systems.

| Unicode codepoint(s) (U+) | Unicode name | Mutant codepoint(s) (U+) | Mutant name |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `1f3f3` `[VS16]` `[ZWJ]` `26a7` `[VS16]` | Transgender Flag | `101681` | Transgender flag |
