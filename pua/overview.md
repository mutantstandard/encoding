# Private Use Area (PUA)
***Please note that as of right now, PUA development is frozen. No new PUA codepoints are being added or planned***

Some of Mutant's unique emoji symbols and modifiers have been encoded in the SPUA planes, in block `1016xx`. This repository outlines what encodings have been made by the project in this area (and potentially subsequent blocks if `1016xx` is filled).

Not all Mutant emoji have encodings - PUA or otherwise.

PUA encodings in Unicode are inherently non-standard, there may be collisions that exist. There are also accessibility concerns too. Please take these into consideration when using any PUA encoding.
