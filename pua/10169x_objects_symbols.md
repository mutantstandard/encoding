# `10169x`: Objects, Symbols and Expressions

Assorted objects, symbols and expressions that have been encoded in Mutant's PUA in the past.

Recently, I've been trying to standardise the use of various symbols, and with some exceptions, these do not neatly fit in with bundles and standards that I am trying to develop, so for now, they are in a weird space.
