# Mutant encoding

**(This repository is incomplete. I am slowly working on migrating old technical documentation to here!)**

This document outlines the encoding mechanics of various symbols within the Mutant emoji set, and what makes them differ (if any) from Unicode.

While Mutant symbols are copyleft, this Private Use Area standard is licensed MIT.
