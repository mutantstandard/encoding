# Mutant Standard Private Use Area (PUA)

**(This repository is incomplete. I am slowly working on migrating old PUA technical documentation to here!)**

Some of Mutant Standard's unique emoji symbols and modifiers have been encoded in the PUA plane, in block `1016xx`. This repository outlines what encodings have been made by the project in this area (and potentially subsequent blocks if `1016xx` is filled).

Not all Mutant Standard emoji have encodings - PUA or otherwise, and currently PUA development is frozen, but I felt like creating a repository with a simple text file would be a much easier way to distribute the PUA standard that currently exist and that various folks already use.

PUA encodings in Unicode are inherently non-standard, there may be collisions that exist. There are also accessibility concerns too. Please take these into consideration when using any PUA encoding.

While Mutant Standard symbols are copyleft, this Private Use Area standard is freely available.
