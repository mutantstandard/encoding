# Bundles

Since its inception, Mutant was developed as one large set. It had some clear goals but a lot of fuzziness around the edges. In 2024, the decision was made to split the set and standard into **bundles** - discrete sections of emoji that can be combined together.

Mutant has emoji symbols designed to cater to different groups of people. Not everyone wants or needs all of them. Furthermore, **Mutant Form** has a very high number of emoji because of its large number of modifier combinations which creates a substantial tradeoff in various situations. So bundles allow people to select what they need for their use case while still creating a consistent standard to facilitate those experiences.

## The different bundles.
**Mutant Core** is the only essential bundle - containing Mutant's unique perspective on Unicode Standard emoji. Other bundles from the set can then be added on for extra communicative functionality.

### Communication extension bundles
Standardised extensions to Mutant Core.
- **Mutant Spectrum** - flags and symbols catering to the queer community.
- **Mutant Form** - modifiers, symbols and expressions catering to furries and those who use non-human representations of themselves.

### Assorted extra stuff
A place for existing emoji that are not covered by Mutant Standard.
- **Mutant Extra** - assorted symbols and objects for various functions.

## Features

### Discrete
Bundles do not share emoji, so every non-Core bundle is a clean addition to Mutant Core.

Wherever possible, a group of emoji concerning one particular subject area or purpose would be in one bundle, but because many of Mutant's non-standard emoji are extensions of emoji that already exist in Unicode, intersections are inevitable.

Certain groups of emoji can be shared between bundles, but only ever a non-Core bundle and Core. Non-Core bundles do not share groups of emoji.

For instance, the `d6` (dice) emoji is in Mutant Core. For the other dice shapes (`d4`, `d6`, etc.), you can add Mutant Extra. You cannot get all of the dice by downloading a single bundle. 

While these cases of having to download 2 bundles to get all of a particular subject range aren't ideal, I took a look at other options and consulted with developers and we collectively decided this was the least difficult way to split emoji.

### Centrally-planned
Mutant emoji and Mutant Standard are produced as one to prevent any name/codepoint collisions and to let additions naturally fit together as best as possible.
