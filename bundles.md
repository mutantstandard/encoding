# Bundles

Since Mutant's inception, It was designed as one large set with some clear goals but a lot of fuzziness around the edges. In 2024, the decision was made to split the set into **bundles** - discrete sections of emoji that can be combined together.

Mutant has emoji symbols designed to cater to different groups of people. Not everyone wants or needs all of them. furthermore the area that is now known as Mutant Form has a very high number of emoji because of the enormous amount of modifier combinations. So bundles allows people to select what they need without undermining a sense of continuity and consistency across the entire set.


## The different bundles.
**Mutant Core** is the only essential bundle - containing Mutant's unique perspective on Unicode Standard emoji. Other bundles from the set can then be added on for extra communicative functionality.

### Standard communication bundles
- **Mutant Spectrum** - flags and symbols catering to the queer community.
- **Mutant Form** - modifiers, symbols and expressions catering to furries and those who use non-human representations of themselves.

### Assorted extra stuff
- **Mutant Extra** - assorted symbols and objects for various functions.

## How emoji are bundled

### Discrete
Bundles do not share emoji, so every non-Core bundle is a clean addition to Mutant Core.

Wherever possible, a group of emoji concerning one particular subject area or purpose would be in one bundle, but because many of Mutant's non-standard emoji are extensions of emoji that already exist in Unicode, intersections are inevitable.

Certain groups of emoji can be shared between bundles, but only ever a non-Core bundle and Core. Non-Core bundles do not share groups of emoji.

For instance, the `d6` (dice) emoji is in Mutant Core. For the other dice shapes (`d4`, `d6`, etc.), you can add Mutant Extra. You cannot get all of the dice by downloading a single bundle. 

While these cases of having to download 2 bundles to get all of a particular subject range aren't ideal, I took a look at other options and consulted with developers and we collectively decided this was the least difficult way to split emoji.

### Centrally-planned
Mutant is still produced as if there is only one emoji set to prevent any name collisions and to let additions naturally fit together.
